            To introduce myself, I am Nishka Pahwa, resident of Vadodara,
            Gujarat state, India. Having grown up in a family that owns and
            operates a medium scaled business, since a young age, I would find
            myself at my father’s side listening to him discuss in serious
            overtones with other associates the nuances of what it takes to
            drive sales, I was fascinated directly with the idea of amplifying
            my pitch so that other people would listen - and most importantly,
            buy into - from both a commercial and ideological sense.

            Ever since a young age, I have refused to understand marketing as a
            concept that represents the mere amalgamation of fancy terms and
            grandiloquent jargons. In a world where essentially society
            progresses, effectively, we're all in a constant, albeit sustainable
            race: that of convincing someone, somebody out there, that what we
            have is better. I absolutely find it spectacular how people seem to
            fail to notice the strong literal connection between the terms
            'market', and 'marketing', which are now used in entirely different
            connotations, yet share the same root word - and marketing, by
            principle, as The New York Times puts its best, is "the art of
            telling stories so enthralling that people lose track of their
            wallets.”

              After my undergrad, I worked and gained variety of experience in
              the forte of Digital Marketing: a freelance consultant with online
              e-commerce stores. I helped launch their Facebook ads, developed
              the digital landscape, and successfully achieved 5+ ROAS (return
              on ad spend) for a store that supplied its products to multiple
              countries. Later, functioned as a Digital Marketing Specialist
              with a performance marketing agency and created, developed and
              launched Facebook and Google ads campaigns, and perform A/B
              testing and ROAS-based optimization for e- commerce clients. I was
              also tasked with training the new staff members and presenting
              audit and media plans for prospective clients.
              <br />
              Finally, I moved ahead to the reputed University of Surrey to
              pursue my Master's in Digital Marketing and Channel Management.
              Collectively, pumped up with practical punch and skilful
              theoretical mentoring, I am looking forward to an opportunity to
              help me learn and provide my best in the field.
